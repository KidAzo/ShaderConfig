🧱 Shader-Based Grid Concealing System for Unity

This system allows dynamic hiding of grid areas based on 3D object colliders in a Unity factory layout simulation. It uses ComputeBuffer to send collider data to a grid material shader, enabling performant and scalable visual feedback.


✨ Features
* 🏗️ Real-time Concealing: Hides grid cells below machines and conveyors.
* 📦 Collider Buffering: Uses ComputeBuffer to pass collider positions and sizes to the shader.
* 🔄 Dynamic Updates: Automatically updates when machines are placed, removed, or custom conceal zones are added.
